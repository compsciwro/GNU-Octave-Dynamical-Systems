# 📈 GNU-Octave-Dynamical-Systems
A collection of GNU Octave scripts for mathematical modeling and analysis, developed for MAT 312 (Mathematics and Applied Mathematics). Includes analytical and numerical solutions to nonlinear differential equations, stability analysis, and dynamical systems modeling. A large portion of the mark allocation was 'own contribution', so I implemented different coloured graphs, see code on I did this. 

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Descartes’ Rule of Signs
- Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion
- Logistic Population Models
- Predator-Prey Interactions
- Nullclines and Phase Portraits
- Analytical vs. Numerical Solutions using Octave
- Interpretation of Dynamic Interactions (e.g., competition, cooperation)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) – for all simulations and numerical work.
- MATLAB-style syntax for compatibility and readability.


## 📝 Notes
Each `.m` file includes comments explaining the logic, assumptions, and solution steps. This repository was created to showcase coursework and assist others in learning applied mathematics via Octave, I included the pdf typed document for the math assigment.
